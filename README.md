# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Delay Prediction & LLM-Based Chatbot
This project predicts flight delay categories using historical and real-time data. It also features an interactive chatbot powered by a local LLM to support natural language flight queries. The app is built with Streamlit, integrates batch and streaming pipelines via Azure, and offers explainable model outputs.

## ‚ÄºÔ∏èPrerequisite
1. Ollama needs to be installed and configured locally in advance.

### Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Delay category distribution
- Histograms of numerical features
- Average arrival delays per airline
- Most delayed airports
- Delay trends by time-related features

### Part 3: LLM-Based Flight Chatbot
- Users can describe flights in natural language
- The system extracts structured information (slots) through LLM
- If information is incomplete, follow-up questions are generated
- The final prediction is explained to the user
